# PERN_Stack_TODO_App_JWT_Auth

Here is the complete code for PERN Stack App for Sign Up and Sign IN functionality made from scratch with the help of (JWT), Json web token.
Token is stored in local storage for session management. Applied bcrypt for password encryption. Added some middlewares for token authentication, authorization and validation of credentials and token.
There is also a middle ware specially added to authenticate token. Token also gets authenticated on page refresh. Logout functioality is also added. Toasts are also added to notify the user about the events.
I have learnt how to combine these technologies to build a full-stack web application and I have shared the complete code in this repository. 
Anyone who wants to learn PERN Stack specially with the usage of JWT, may clone this git repo as the code is completely refined and understanable and Yes,
Comments are also specially added for understanding.

Happy Coding! üòç ~Usman Abbas
